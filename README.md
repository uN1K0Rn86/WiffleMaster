# WiffleMaster
A webapp for keeping score, analyzing statistics, and managing players, teams, and leagues in wiffleball.

The goal of this project is to create an application where users can create and manage their own leagues, teams, and players. The app will be created using python and the flask webapp library, and the database will be managed using postgreSQL.

The goal is for each pitch to be logged into the database separately, so that the app produces detailed statistics for analytic purposes. Each pitch will have identifiers for the pitcher, batter, game, teams, and league in question so that data can be filtered and sorted.

This project will be used in the University of Helsinki course regarding databases and web development. The scope of the project is ambitious in relation to the requirements of the course, but the project is one I want to complete regardless, so I see this as a good opportunity to combine education with my own interests.
